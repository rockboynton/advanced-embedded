# LAB3 â€“ Compiler Optimization

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to become familiar and gain some experience with
different optimization settings in a compiler. In particular, we want to observe and analyze the
effects of a variety of optimization levels on code size produced and speed.

Also, it is important to learn what code constructs are *optimize-able*, and implement them
so the effects of the compiler are more obvious.

## Description

This laboratory consists of writing heavily inefficient code to run on the MSP432 implementing
constructs that are typically able to be optimized by a compiler depending on the optimization level
and preference for speed vs. size.

Here is a list of some of those constructs I implemented:

* Including unnecessary header files
* Nested small function blocks
* Declaring unused variables
* Performing complex calculations that should be pre-calculated
* Using powers of two for multiplication and division
* Calling functions in a loop
* Nested if/else constructs
* Using recursive functions

See comments in the code for more

The code is measured for time accurately by toggling an output pin in each loop of the main program
and measuring the time period with an oscilloscope, so 1/2 the period of the pin is the runtime of
an iteration of the loop

## Conclusions

Optimization is always a topic I found interesting, but haven't been able to explore much in my
previous coursework. Seeing how much faster the code ran (~96% faster at level 5) after pumping up
the optimization level was really cool to see. I hope I can utilize what I have learned when writing
more complex code that actually does something useful!

Writing intentionally inefficient code was interesting, but good to make the ideas more concrete and
understand what not to do when writing code for efficiency.

I also hadn't thought of using a GPIO pin to accurately measure time using something in the C
standard library, but I can see how that can be useful, especially in embedded environments.

Description:
    This is a code written in a very inefficient manner in the hopes of observing
    the effects of the TI compiler optimization settings. There are a variety of
    intentional inefficient areas of the code, which provide opportunities for
    optimization.

    The code runtime is measured by toggling an output pin (P5.0) and viewing the period
    in an oscilloscope, where half the period would be one loop of the program.
