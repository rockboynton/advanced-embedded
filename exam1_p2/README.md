## 1. (50 pts.) Finite State Machine (FSM).

Implement your FSM of lab 4 using the alternate method of implementing FSMs (i.e., the lab used the Look Up Table (LUT) method, implement it using the nested if-else method). Start with a copy of your lab code and replace the LUT portion with an if-else implementation (or nested switch statements). Feel free to reuse the other parts of the code.

Submit a printout of your code, including any files you reuse from the lab code, into OneNote. Demo
the correct functionality on the MSP432 Launchpad.
