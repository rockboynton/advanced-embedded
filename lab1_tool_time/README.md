## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to become familiar with the Code Composer
Studio development environment and gain some experience with the MSP32
including using it to interface with an LCD display and set GPIO pins
connected to things like a pushbutton and an LED. The purpose of this
lab also included learning how to use the provide MSOE libraries for the
more complex peripherals like the LCD.

## Description

This lab consists of wiring up the LCD to the MSP432 LaunchPad
development board, as dictated by the MSOE LCD library, then writing a C
program to print the text "EE4930" and then repeatedly do the following:

Read the state of a pushbutton switch connected to one of the GPIO
inputs.

-   If the pushbutton is not pressed:

    -   turn off an LED connected to one of the GPIO pins. Also, on the
        LCD display, write the following text on the second and third
        lines:

        > OFF
        >
        > First name

-   Where 'First name' is replaced with the first 12 letters of my first
    name, i.e., "Rock."

-   Blanks the fourth line, so that if there was text there, it will
    disappear.


-   If the pushbutton is pressed:

    -   turn on the LED. Also, on the LCD display, write the following
        text on the second and fourth lines:

        > ON
        >
        > Last name

-   Where 'Last name' is replaced with the first 12 letters of my last
    name, i.e., "Boynton."

-   Blanks the fourth line, so that if there was text there, it will
    disappear.

The text displayed on the first line of the LCD is written there once,
and only once. It is not re-written every time I change other lines on
the LCD.

Some functions you can use for interfacing to the display are located in
the MSOE_LIB library.

## Conclusions

This lab was a really nice introduction to the TI development platform
and using Code Composer Studio (CCS) as well as got me familiar with
using the LCD and GPIO of the MSP432. I was able to find all of the
resources I needed, but they were in a variety of places and mediums,
including webpages, PowerPoints, and datasheets.

Print "EE4930" to the first line of the LCD display
On the next 2 lines of the LCD, read pushbutton S1:
if off, turn off an LED and print
    OFF
    Rock
else on, turn on an LED and print
    ON
